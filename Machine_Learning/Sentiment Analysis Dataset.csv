They are 2 years old and 7 months and I love them, but they also require so much attention that my anxiety is higher than ever. I am often overwhelmed by the care the require, but at the same, I am so excited to see them hit developmental and social milestones.","{

It is a challenge to have the family together and have them get along.  There are many differences between the children but they do want to participate in activities together.  I think that if they could just figure out how to help each other and that they could make a good team that they will be best friends.  Sometimes they surprise me with their time together and kindness and sharing with each other.  Other times they cause a lot of excitement and frustration in trying to get them to work together.  I am happy when they all can be together and enjoy each other.,"{

"In an effort to continue to try new things as it relates to freelance work I did a gig yesterday for a show being setup in Tampa. I found that the lady that hired me treats workers as slaves, talks down to us, and doesn't appear to believe any of use had brains. I'm not certain if this was based on previous experiences or her personality, but it made for a long ten hour day and many frustrations. I never walk out on jobs, because I believe I can learn something new from every experience and try to do this with each undertaking.

"So yesterday, I spent most of my working time testing and debugging the new code I wrote to automatically log a user back in when they time out, AND run whatever command they were trying to run when the program realized they'd timed out. The login part works great! And the running the command part works too - as long as there's only ONE command. If a single action, like a click, triggers TWO commands - like for instance, if clicking anywhere in a widget selects it, and clicking a button within it also contacts the DB - then only the first one runs and I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. I can't debug it because every time I pause the code to step through it, the behavior changes! I suppose that in itself helps me narrow it down some - it must be a timing issue in some way - but I'm really stumped. I'll work on it some more today, I guess. I hate bugs I can't trace well, I feel like I don't have a good handle on how to find them. I mostly just stare at the code until inspiration strikes.","{

Also, because she's a stray I have no idea how old she is, but she looks more than old enough to have kittens, and I can't afford them, so I was in a hurry to get her fixed. Now that I have an appointment for next week, at a place that will actually treat her like a PET, which she IS, I feel better. I still have to figure out how I'm going to get her into the cat carrier that morning - I fully expect her to panic over some noise or other the night before, hide under the bed and refuse to come out - but at least it's only ONE thing to worry about, and after that, it's all downhill unless she gets an infection.","{

I had been talking to someone who I had thought was a friend but they wound up telling lies. The friendship had turned quickly into something of a relationship more on their end and lies were told by me in order for them to send me money. I finally decided to tell them that I wanted to have the truth and honesty back which now has become very dramatic and time consuming. It is frustrating because they continue to play the victim despite the lies told by them and each conversation just goes in circles. I thought being honest was the best interest for the both of us but it seems to make things worse.I am frustrated that they do not see their wrong doings and due to me telling the truth they continue to bring up their hurt feelings and not acknowledging mine. I tried to block them and just stop speaking but was told to try and get more money from them which is what made things go horribly wrong but they did not even notice they were not even talking to me at all. They have personal information about me and keep using that as a weapon against me when all I want to do is either start over as friends as I intended or just stop communicating in whole.,"{
